		<h2 class="title"> The Colors of A Place 
		</h2>
		
		<p>In order to look at how color scheme plays out in different places,
		I found photographs that I took my hometown, State College, Pennsylvania as well as 
		photographs from my time in New York City. Once I gathered my photographs, I extracted the 
		dominant color and compiled those colors. Below you can click on the place you want to look at further.
		From their you can look at the photographs that insired the colors.
