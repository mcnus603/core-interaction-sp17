			In the section about Bill Atkinson, Moldridge traces the qualities about Atkinson that made him a successful designer especially during his time designing Linda for Apple. Atkinson shows that attention to detail, problem solving, thinking outside of the box and not being too comfortable with precedents, and rigid testing goes a long way.

			The section with Bill Verplank not only shows you some good guidelines and questions to ask yourself when designing an interface. The text which was accompanied by Verplank's illustration shows how a successful interface designer looks at and organizes his thoughts. This section helped put me in a mindset that a user interaction is in.
