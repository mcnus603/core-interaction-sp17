						the wife of a rich man fell sick, and as she felt that her end was drawing near, she called her only daughter to her bedside and said, dear child, be good and pious, and then the good God will always protect you, and I will look down on you from heaven and be near you.  Thereupon she closed her eyes andd eparted. Every day the maiden went out to her mother's grave, and wept, and she remained pious and good. When winter came the snow spread a white sheet over the grave, and by the time the spring sun had drawn it off again, the man had taken another wife. The woman had brought with her into the house two daughters, who were beautiful and fair of face, but vile and black of heart. Now began a bad time for the poor step-child.  Is the stupid goose to sit in the parlor with us, they said. He who wants to eat bread must earn it. Out with the kitchen-wench. They took her pretty clothes away from her, put an old grey bedgown on her, and gave her wooden shoes.  Just look at the proud princess, how decked out she is, they cried, and laughed, and led her into the kitchen. There she had to do hard work from morning till night, get up before daybreak, carry water, light fires, cook and wash. Besides this, the sisters did her every imaginable injury - they mocked her and emptied her peas and lentils into the ashes, so that she was forced to sit and pick them out again.  In the evening when she had worked till she was weary she had no bed to go to, but had to sleep by the hearth in the cinders. And as on that account she always looked dusty and dirty, they called her cinderella.

						It happened that the father was once going to the fair, and heasked his two step-daughters what he should bring back for them. Beautiful dresses, said one, pearls and jewels, said the second. And you, cinderella, said he, what will you have. Father break off for me the first branch which knocks against your hat on your way home. So he bought beautiful dresses, pearls and jewels for his two step-daughters, and on his way home, as he was riding through a green thicket, a hazel twig brushed against him and knocked off his hat. Then he broke off the branch and took it with him.  When he reached home he gave his step-daughters the things which they had wished for, and to cinderella he gave the branch from the hazel-bush. Cinderella thanked him, went to her mother's grave and planted the branch on it, and wept so much that the tears fell down on it and watered it. And it grew and became a handsome tree. Thrice a day cinderella went and sat beneath it, and wept and prayed, and a little white bird always came on the tree, and if cinderella expressed a wish, the bird threw down to her what she had wished for.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="cinderella_text">
						It happened, however, that the king gave orders for a festival which was to last three days, and to which all the beautiful young girls in the country were invited, in order that his son might choose himself a bride.  When the two step-sisters heard that they too were to appear among the number, they were delighted, called cinderella and said, comb our hair for us, brush our shoes and fasten our buckles, for we are going to the wedding at the king's palace. Cinderella obeyed, but wept, because she too would have liked to go with them to the dance, and begged her step-mother to allow her to do so. You go, cinderella, said she, covered in dust and dirt as you are, and would go to the festival. You have no clothes and shoes, and yet would dance. As, however, cinderella went on asking, the step-mother said at last, I have emptied a dish of lentils into the ashes for you, if you have picked them out again in two hours, you shall go with us. The maiden went through the back-door into the garden, and called, you tame pigeons, you turtle-doves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to pick the good into the pot,the bad into the crop.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="cinderella_text"> 
						Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen window, and afterwards the turtle-doves, and at last all the birds beneath the sky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes. And the pigeons nodded with their heads and began pick, pick, pick, pick, and the rest began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and gathered all the good grains into the dish. Hardly had one hour passed before they had finished, and all flew out again. Then the girl took the dish to her step-mother, and was glad, and believed that now she would be allowed to go with them to the festival. But the step-mother said, no, cinderella, you have no clothes and you can not dance.  You would only be laughed at.  And as cinderella wept at this, the step-mother said, if you can pick two dishes of lentils out of the ashes for me in one hour, you shall go with us. And she thought to herself, that she most certainly cannot do again. When the step-mother had emptied the two dishes of lentils amongst the ashes, the maiden went through the back-door into the garden and cried, you tame pigeons, you turtle-doves, and all you birds beneath the sky, come and help me to pick the good into the pot,the bad into the crop.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="cinderella_text">
						Then two white pigeons came in by the kitchen-window, and afterwards the turtle-doves, and at length all the birds beneath the sky, came whirring and crowding in, and alighted amongst the ashes. And the doves nodded with their heads and began pick,pick, pick, pick, and the others began also pick, pick, pick, pick, and gathered all the good seeds into the dishes, and before half an hour was over they had already finished, and all flew out again. Then the maiden was delighted, and believed that she might now go with them to the wedding. But the step-mother said, all this will not help. You cannot go with us, for you have no clothes and can not dance. We should be ashamed of you. On this she turned her back on cinderella, and hurried away with her two proud daughters. As no one was now at home, cinderella went to her mother's grave beneath the hazel-tree, and cried-shiver and quiver, little tree, silver and gold throw down over me.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="cinderella_text">
						Then the bird threw a gold and silver dress down to her, and slippers embroidered with silk and silver. She put on the dress with all speed, and went to the wedding. Her step-sisters and the step-mother however did not know her, and thought she must be a foreign princess, for she looked so beautiful in the golden dress. They never once thought of cinderella, and believed that she was sitting at home in the dirt, picking lentils out of the ashes. The prince approached her, took her by the hand and danced with her. He would dance with no other maiden, and never let loose of her hand, and if any one else came to invite her, he said, this is my partner. She danced till it was evening, and then she wanted to go home. But the king's son said, I will go with you and bear you company, for he wished to see to whom the beautiful maiden belonged. She escaped from him, however, and sprang into the pigeon-house. The king's son waited until her father came, and then he told him that the unknown maiden had leapt into the pigeon-house. The old man thought, can it be cinderella. And they had to bring him an axe and a pickaxe that he might hew the pigeon-house to pieces, but no one was inside it. And when they got home cinderella lay in her dirty clothes among the ashes, and a dim little oil-lamp was burning on the mantle-piece, for cinderella had jumped quickly down from the back of the pigeon-house and had run to the little hazel-tree, and there she had taken off her beautiful clothes and laid them on the grave, and the bird had taken them away again, and then she had seated herself in the kitchen amongst the ashes in her grey gown. Next day when the festival began afresh, and her parents and the step-sisters had gone once more, cinderella went to the hazel-tree and said-shiver and quiver, my little tree,silver and gold throw down over me.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="cinderella_text">
						Then the bird threw down a much more beautiful dress than on the preceding day. And when cinderella appeared at the wedding in this dress, every one was astonished at her beauty. The king's son had waited until she came, and instantly took her by the hand and danced with no one but her.  When others came and invited her, he said, this is my partner.  When evening came she wished to leave, and the king's son followed her and wanted to see into which house she went. But she sprang away from him, and into the garden behind the house. Therein stood a beautiful tall tree on which hung the most magnificent pears. She clambered so nimbly between the branches like a squirrel that the king's son did not know where she was gone.  He waited until her father came, and said to him, the unknown maiden has escaped from me, and I believe she has climbed up the pear-tree.  The father thought, can it be cinderella. And had an axe brought and cut the tree down, but no one was on it. And when they got into the kitchen, cinderella lay there among the ashes, as usual, for she had jumped down on the other side of the tree, had taken the beautiful dress to the bird on the little hazel-tree, and put on her grey gown. On the third day, when the parents and sisters had gone away,cinderella went once more to her mother's grave and said to the little tree-shiver and quiver, my little tree,silver and gold throw down over me.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="cinderella_text">
						And now the bird threw down to her a dress which was more splendid and magnificent than any she had yet had, and the slippers were golden.  And when she went to the festival in the dress, no one knew how to speak for astonishment. The king's son danced with her only, and if any one invited her to dance, he said this is my partner. When evening came, cinderella wished to leave, and the king's son was anxious to go with her, but she escaped from him so quickly that he could not follow her. The king's son, however, had employed a ruse, and had caused the whole staircase to be smeared with pitch, and there, when she ran down, had the maiden's left slipper remained stuck. The king's son picked it up, and it was small and dainty, and all golden. Next morning, he went with it to the father, and said to him, no one shall be my wife but she whose foot this golden slipper fits.  Then were the two sisters glad, for they had pretty feet. The eldest went with the shoe into her room and wanted to try it on, and her mother stood by. But she could not get her big toe into it, and the shoe was too small for her.  Then her mother gave her a knife and said, cut the toe off, when you are queen you will have no more need to go on foot. The maiden cut the toe off, forced the foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the king's son. Then he took her on his his horse as his bride and rode away with her. They were obliged, however, to pass the grave, and there, on the hazel-tree, sat the two pigeons and cried-turn and peep, turn and peep,there's blood within the shoe, the shoe it is too small for her,the true bride waits for you.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="cinderella_text">
						Then he looked at her foot and saw how the blood was trickling from it. He turned his horse round and took the false bride home again, and said she was not the true one, and that the other sister was to put the shoe on. Then this one went into her chamber and got her toes safely into the shoe, but her heel was too large.  So her mother gave her a knife and said,  cut a bit off your heel, when you are queen you will have no more need to go on foot. The maiden cut a bit off her heel, forced her foot into the shoe, swallowed the pain, and went out to the king's son. He took her on his horse as his bride, and rode away with her, but when they passed by the hazel-tree, the two pigeons sat on it and cried-turn and peep, turn and peep,there's blood within the shoe, the shoe it is too small for her,the true bride waits for you.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="cinderella_text">
						He looked down at her foot and saw how the blood was running out of her shoe, and how it had stained her white stocking quite red. Then he turned his horse and took the false bride home again. This also is not the right one, said he, have you no other daughter. No, said the man, there is still a little stunted kitchen-wench which my late wife left behind her, but she cannot possibly be the bride. The king's son said he was to send her up to him, but the mother answered, oh, no, she is much too dirty, she cannot show herself. But he absolutely insisted on it, and cinderella had to be called. She first washed her hands and face clean, and then went and bowed down before the king's son, who gave her the golden shoe.  Then she seated herself on a stool, drew her foot out of the heavy wooden shoe, and put it into the slipper, which fitted like a glove. And when she rose up and the king's son looked at her face he recognized the beautiful maiden who had danced with him and cried, that is the true bride. The step-mother and the two sisters were horrified and became pale with rage, he, however, took cinderella on his horse and rode away with her. As they passed by the hazel-tree, the two white doves cried-turn and peep, turn and peep, no blood is in the shoe, the shoe is not too small for her,the true bride rides with you,and when they had cried that, the two came flying down and placed themselves on cinderella's shoulders, one on the right, the other on the left, and remained sitting there.

When the betrothed couple went to church, the elder was at the right side and the younger at the left, and the pigeons pecked out one eye from each of them. Afterwards as they came back the elder was at the left, and the younger at the right, and then the pigeons pecked out the other eye from each. And thus,

				<p> 
					<div class="line" id="childless_rapunzel">
						there was a man and a woman who had long in vain wished for a child.
					</div>
					<div class="rapunzel_text"> 
						At length the woman hoped that God was about to grant her desire. These people had a little window at the back of their house from which a splendid garden could be seen, which was full of the most beautiful flowers and herbs. It was, however, surrounded by a high wall, and no one dared to go into it because it belonged to an enchantress, who had great power and was dreaded by all the world.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						One day the woman was standing by this window and looking down into the garden, when she saw a bed which was planted with the most beautiful rampion - Rapunzel, and it looked so fresh and green that she longed for it, and had the greatest desire to eat some. This desire increased every day, and as she knew that she could not get any of it, she quite pined away, and began to look pale and miserable.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						Then her husband was alarmed, and asked, "What ails you, dear wife?"
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						"Ah," she replied, "if I can't eat some of the rampion, which is in the garden behind our house, I shall die."
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						The man, who loved her, thought, sooner than let your wife die, bring her some of the rampion yourself, let it cost what it will. At twilight, he clambered down over the wall into the garden of the enchantress, hastily clutched a handful of rampion, and took it to his wife. She at once made herself a salad of it, and ate it greedily. It tasted so good to her - so very good, that the next day she longed for it three times as much as before. If he was to have any rest, her husband must once more descend into the garden. In the gloom of evening, therefore, he let himself down again. But when he had clambered down the wall he was terribly afraid, for he saw the enchantress standing before him.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						"How can you dare," said she with angry look, "descend into my garden and steal my rampio	n like a thief? You shall suffer for it."
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						"Ah," answered he, "let mercy take the place of justice, I only made up my mind to do it out of necessity. My wife saw your rampion from the window, and felt such a longing for it that she would have died if she had not got some to eat."
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						Then the enchantress allowed her anger to be softened, and said to him, "If the case be as you say, I will allow you to take away with you as much rampion as you will, only I make one condition, you must give me the child which your wife will bring into the world. It shall be well treated, and I will care for it like a mother."
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						The man in his terror consented to everything, and when the woman 	was brought to bed, the enchantress appeared at once, gave the child the name of Rapunzel, and took it away with her.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						Rapunzel grew into the most beautiful child under the sun. When she was twelve years old, the enchantress shut her into a tower, which lay in a forest, and had neither stairs nor door, but quite at the top was a little window. When the enchantress wanted to go in, she placed herself beneath it and cried,
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						"Rapunzel, Rapunzel,Let down your hair!" Rapunzel had magnificent long hair, fine as spun gold, and when she heard the voice of the enchantress she unfastened her braided tresses, wound them round one of the hooks of the window above, and then the hair fell twenty ells down, and the enchantress climbed up by it.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						After a year or two, it came to pass that the king's son rode through the forest and passed by the tower. Then he heard a song, which was so charming that he stood still and listened. This was Rapunzel, who in her solitude passed her time in letting her sweet voice resound. The king's son wanted to climb up to her, and looked for the door of the tower, but none was to be found. He rode home, but the singing had so deeply touched his heart, that every day he went out into the forest and listened to it. Once when he was thus standing behind a tree, he saw that an enchantress came there, and he heard how she cried,
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair!"
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">	
						Then Rapunzel let down the braids of her hair, and the enchantress climbed up to her. "If that is the ladder by which one mounts, I too will try my fortune," said he, and the next day when it began to grow dark, he went to the tower and cried,"Rapunzel, Rapunzel, Let down your hair!"
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						Immediately the hair fell down and the king's son climbed up. At first Rapunzel was terribly frightened when a man, such as her eyes had never yet beheld, came to her. But the king's son began to talk to her quite like a friend, and told her that his heart had been so stirred that it had let him have no rest, and he had been forced to see her. Then Rapunzel lost her fear, and when he asked her if she would take him for her husband, and she saw that he was young and handsome, she thought, he will love me more than old dame gothel does. And she said yes, and laid her hand in his.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						She said, "I will willingly go away with you, but I do not know how to get down. Bring with you a skein of silk every time that you come, and I will weave a ladder with it, and when that is ready I will descend, and you will take me on your horse."
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						They agreed that until that time he should come to her every evening, for the old woman came by day.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						The enchantress remarked nothing of this, until once Rapunzel said 	to her, "Tell me, Dame Gothel, how it happens that you are so much heavier for me to draw up than the young king's son - he is with me in a moment."
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						"Ah! You wicked child," cried the enchantress. "What do I hear you say. I thought I had separated you from all the world, and yet you have deceived me."
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						In her anger she clutched Rapunzel's beautiful tresses, wrapped them twice round her left hand, seized a pair of scissors with the right, and snip, snap, they were cut off, and the lovely braids lay on the ground. And she was so pitiless that she took poor Rapunzel into a desert where she had to live in great grief and misery.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						On the same day that she cast out Rapunzel, however, the enchantress fastened the braids of hair, which she had cut off, to the hook of the window, and when the king's son came and cried, "Rapunzel, Rapunzel,Let down your hair!"She let the hair down. The king's son ascended, but instead of finding his dearest Rapunzel, he found the enchantress, who gazed at him with wicked and venomous looks.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						"Aha," she cried mockingly, "you would fetch your dearest, but the beautiful bird sits no longer singing in the nest. The cat has got it, and will scratch out your eyes as well. Rapunzel is lost to you. You will never see her again."
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						The king's son was beside himself with pain, and in his despair he leapt down from the tower. He escaped with his life, but the thorns into which he fell pierced his eyes. Then he wandered quite blind about the forest, ate nothing but roots and berries, and did naught but lament and weep over the loss of his dearest wife.
					</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					<div class="rapunzel_text">
						Thus he roamed about in misery for some years, and at length came to the desert where Rapunzel, with the twins to which she had given birth, a boy and a girl, lived in wretchedness. He heard a voice, and it seemed so familiar to him that he went towards it, and when he approached, Rapunzel knew him and fell on his neck and wept. Two of her tears wetted his eyes and they grew clear again, and he could see with them as before. He led her to his kingdom where he was joyfully received, and

Before each of the fairies was placed a plate with a spoon, a knife, and a fork all pure gold. But alas! As the fairies were about to seat themselves at the table, there came into the hall a very old fairy who had not been invited. She had left the kingdom fifty years before and had not been seen or heard of until this day. The king at once ordered that a plate should be brought for her, but he could not furnish a gold one such as the others had. This made the old fairy angry, and she sat there muttering to herself.

				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						At this all the guests trembled, and many of them began to weep. The king and queen wept loudest of all.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						Just then the wise young fairy came from behind the curtain and said: “Do not grieve, O King and Queen. Your daughter shall not die. I cannot undo what my elder sister has done; the princess shall indeed prick her finger with the spindle, but she shall not die. She shall fall into sleep that will last a hundred years. At the end of that time, a king’s son will find her and awaken her.” Immediately all the fairies vanished.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						The king, hoping to save his child even from this misfortune, commanded that all spindles should be burned. This was done, but it was all in vain.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						One day when the princess was seventeen years of age, the king and queen left her alone in the castle. She wandered about the palace and at last came to a little room in the top of a tower. There an old woman, so old and deaf that she had never heard of the king’s command sat spinning.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						“What are you doing, good old woman?” asked the princess.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						“I am spinning, my pretty child.”
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						“Ah,” said the princess. “How do you do it? Let me see if I can spin also.”
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						She had just taken the spindle in her hand when, in some way,
					</div>
					<div class="line" id="pricked_sleeping_beauty">
						 it pricked her finger.
					</div>
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						 The princess dropped down on the floor. The old woman called for help, and people came from all sides, but nothing could be done.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						When the good young fairy heard the news, she came quickly to the castle. She knew that the princess must sleep a hundred years and would be frightened if she found herself alone when she awoke. So the fairy touched with her magic wand all in the palace except the king and the queen. Ladies, gentlemen, pages, waiting maids, footmen, grooms in the stable, and even the horses, she touched them all. They all went to sleep just where they were when the wand touched them. Some of the gentlemen were bowing to the ladies, the ladies were embroidering, the grooms stood currying their horses, and the cook was slapping the kitchen boy.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						The king and queen departed from the castle, giving orders that no one was to go near it. This command, however, was not needed. In a little while there sprang around the castle a wood so thick that neither man nor beast could pass through.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						A great many changes take place in a hundred years. The king had no other child, and when he died, his throne passed to another royal family. Even the story of the sleeping princess was almost forgotten.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						One day the son of the king who was then reigning was out hunting, and he saw towers rising above a thick wood. He asked what they were, but no one could answer him.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						At last an old peasant was found who said, “Your highness, fifty 	years ago my father told me that there is a castle in the woods where a princess sleeps, the most beautiful princess that ever lived. It was said that she must sleep there a hundred years, when she would be awakened by a king’s son.”
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						At this the young prince determined to find out the truth for himself. He leaped from his horse and began to force his way through the wood. To his astonishment, the stiff branches gave way, and then closed again, allowing none of his companions to follow.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						A beautiful palace rose before him. In the courtyard the prince saw horses and men who looked as if they were dead. But he was not afraid and boldly entered the palace. There were guards motionless as stone, gentlemen and ladies, pages and footmen, some standing, some sitting, but all like statues.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						At last the prince came to a chamber of gold, where he saw upon a bed the fairest sight one ever beheld, a princess of about seventeen years who looked as if she had just fallen asleep. Trembling, the prince knelt beside her, and awakened her with a kiss. And now the enchantment was broken.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						The princess looked at him with wondering eyes and said: “Is it you, my prince? I have waited for you long.”
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						So happy were the two that they talked hour after hour. In the 	meantime all in the palace awaked and each began to do what he was doing when he fell asleep. The gentlemen went on bowing to the ladies. The ladies went on with their embroidery. The grooms went on currying their horses, the cook went on slapping the kitchen boy, and the servants began to serve the supper. Then the chief lady in waiting, who was ready to die of hunger, told the princess aloud that supper was ready.
					</div> 
				</p>
				<p> 
					<div class="sleeping_beauty_text">
						The prince gave the princess his hand, and they all went into the great hall for supper.

						<div class="snow_white_text">
						 Three drops of blood fell into the snow. The red on the white looked so beautiful that she thought to herself, "If only I had a child as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as the wood in this frame."Soon afterward she had a little daughter who was as white as snow, as red as blood, and as black as ebony wood, and therefore they called her Little Snow White. And as soon as the child was born, the queen died.

						<div class="snow_white_text">
							A year later the king took himself another wife. She was a beautiful woman, but she was proud and arrogant, and she could 	not stand it if anyone might surpass her in beauty. She had a magic mirror. Every morning she stood before it, looked at herself, and said: Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is fairest of all? To this the mirror answered:
						</div>

					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							You, my queen, are fairest of all.Then she was satisfied, for she knew that the mirror spoke the truth.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Snow White grew up and became ever more beautiful. When she was seven years old she was as beautiful as the light of day, even more beautiful than the queen herself.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> <div class="snow_white_text">
							One day when the queen asked her mirror: <br>

							Mirror, mirror, on the wall, <br>
							Who in this land is fairest of all? <br>
							It answered:<br>
							You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White is a thousand times fairer than you.The queen took fright and turned yellow and green with envy. From that hour on whenever she looked at Snow White her heart turned over inside her body, so great was her hatred for the girl. The envy and pride grew ever greater, like a weed in her heart, until she had no peace day and night.
							</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Then she summoned a huntsman and said to him, "Take Snow White out into the woods. I never want to see her again. Kill her, and as proof that she is dead bring her lungs and her liver back to me."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p>
						 <div class="snow_white_text">
							The huntsman obeyed and took Snow White into the woods. He took out his hunting knife and was about to stab it into her innocent heart when she began to cry, saying, "Oh, dear huntsman, let me live. I will run into the wild woods and never come back."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Because she was so beautiful the huntsman took pity on her, and he said, "Run away, you poor child."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							He thought, "The wild animals will soon devour you anyway," but still it was as if a stone had fallen from his heart, for he would not have to kill her.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Just then a young boar came running by. He killed it, cut out its lungs and liver, and took them back to the queen as proof of Snow White's death. The cook had to boil them with salt, and the wicked woman ate them, supposing that she had eaten Snow White's lungs and liver.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							he poor child was now all alone in the great forest, and she was so afraid that she just looked at all the leaves on the trees and did not know what to do. Then she began to run. She ran over sharp stones and through thorns, and wild animals jumped at her, but they did her no harm. She ran as far as her feet could carry her, and just as evening was about to fall she saw a little house and went inside in order to rest.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Inside the house everything was small, but so neat and clean that no one could say otherwise. There was a little table with a white tablecloth and seven little plates, and each plate had a spoon, and there were seven knives and forks and seven mugs as well. Against the wall there were seven little beds, all standing in a row and covered with Snow White sheets.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Because she was so hungry and thirsty Snow White ate a few vegetables and a little bread from each little plate, and from each mug she drank a drop of wine. Afterward, because she was so tired, she lay down on a bed, but none of them felt right, one was too long, the other too short, until finally the seventh one was just right. She remained lying in it, entrusted herself to God, and fell asleep.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							After dark the masters of the house returned home. They were the 
						</div>
						<div class="line" id="seven_snow_white">
							seven dwarfs 
						</div>
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							who picked and dug for ore in the mountains. They lit their seven candles, and as soon as it was light in their house they saw that someone had been there, for not everything was in the same order as they had left it.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The first one said, "Who has been sitting in my chair?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The second one, "Who has been eating from my plate?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The third one, "Who has been eating my bread?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The fourth one, "Who has been eating my vegetables?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The fifth one, "Who has been sticking with my fork?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The sixth one, "Who has been cutting with my knife?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The seventh one, "Who has been drinking from my mug?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Then the first one saw a that there was a little imprint in his bed, and said, "Who stepped on my bed?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The others came running up and shouted, "Someone has been lying in mine as well."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							But the seventh one, looking at his bed, found Snow White lying there asleep. The seven dwarfs all came running up, and they cried out with amazement. They fetched their seven candles and shone the light on Snow White. "Oh good heaven! Oh good heaven!" they cried. "This child is so beautiful!"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							They were so happy, that they did not wake her up, but let her continue to sleep there in the bed. The seventh dwarf had to sleep with his companions, one hour with each one, and then the night was done.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The next morning Snow White woke up, and when she saw the seven dwarfs she was frightened. But they were friendly and asked, "What is your name?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"My name is Snow White," she answered.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"How did you find your way to our house?" the dwarfs asked 	further.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Then she told them that her stepmother had tried to kill her, that the huntsman had spared her life, and that she had run the entire day, finally coming to their house.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The dwarfs said, "If you will keep house for us, and cook, make beds, wash, sew, and knit, and keep everything clean and orderly, then you can stay with us, and you shall have everything that you want."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"Yes," said Snow White, "with all my heart."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							So she kept house for them. Every morning they went into the mountains looking for ore and gold, and in the evening when they came back home their meal had to be ready. During the day the girl was alone.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The good dwarfs warned her, saying, "Be careful about your stepmother. She will soon know that you are here. Do not let anyone in."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Now the queen, believing that she had eaten Snow White's lungs and liver, could only think that she was again the first and the most beautiful woman of all. She stepped before her mirror and said:
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is fairest of all? It answered:
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White, beyond the mountains With the seven dwarfs, is still a thousand times fairer than you.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							This startled the queen, for she knew that the mirror did not lie, and she realized that the huntsman had deceived her, and that Snow White was still alive. Then she thought, and thought again, how she could kill Snow White, for as long as long as she was not the most beautiful woman in the entire land her envy would give her no rest.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							At last she thought of something. Coloring her face, she disguised herself as an old peddler woman, so that no one would recognize her. In this disguise she went to the house of the seven dwarfs. Knocking on the door she called out, "Beautiful wares for sale, for sale!"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Snow White peered out the window and said, "Good day, dear woman, what do you have for sale?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"Good wares, beautiful wares," she answered. "Bodice laces in all colors." And she took out one that was braided from colorful silk. "Would you like this one?"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"I can let that honest woman in," thought Snow White, then unbolted the door and bought the pretty bodice lace.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"Child," said the old woman, "how you look! Come, let me lace you up properly."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The unsuspecting Snow White stood before her and let her do up the new lace, but the old woman pulled so quickly and so hard that Snow White could not breathe.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"You used to be the most beautiful one," said the old woman, and hurried away.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Not long afterward, in the evening time, the seven dwarfs came home. How terrified they were when they saw their dear Snow White lying on the ground, not moving at all, as though she were dead. They lifted her up, and, seeing that she was too tightly laced, they cut the lace in two. Then she began to breathe a little, and little by little she came back to life.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							When the dwarfs heard what had happened they said, "The old peddler woman was no one else but the godless queen. Take care and let no one in when we are not with you."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							When the wicked woman returned home she went to her mirror and asked:
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Mirror, mirror, on the wall, Who in this land is fairest of all? The mirror answered once again:
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White, beyond the mountains With the seven dwarfs, Is still a thousand times fairer than you. When she heard that, all her blood ran to her heart because she knew that Snow White had come back to life.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"This time," she said, "I shall think of something that will destroy you."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Then with the art of witchcraft, which she understood, she made a poisoned comb. Then she disguised herself, taking the form of a different old woman. Thus she went across the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs, knocked on the door, and called out, "Good wares for sale, for sale!"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Snow White looked out and said, "Go on your way. I am not allowed to let anyone in."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"You surely may take a look," said the old woman, pulling out the poisoned comb and holding it up. The child liked it so much that she let herself be deceived, and she opened the door.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							After they had agreed on the purchase, the old woman said, "Now let me comb your hair properly."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							She had barely stuck the comb into Snow White's hair when the poison took effect, and the girl fell down unconscious.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"You specimen of beauty," said the wicked woman, "now you are finished." And she walked away.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Fortunately it was almost evening, and the seven dwarfs came home. When they saw Snow White lying on the ground as if she were dead, they immediately suspected her stepmother. They examined her and found the poisoned comb. They had scarcely pulled it out when Snow White came to herself again and told them what had happened. Once again they warned her to be on guard and not to open the door for anyone.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Back at home the queen stepped before her mirror and said:
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who in this land is fairest of all? The mirror answered:
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							You, my queen, are fair; it is true. But Snow White, beyond the mountains with the seven dwarfs, is still a thousand times fairer than you. When the queen heard the mirror saying this, she shook and trembled with anger, "Snow White shall die," she shouted, "if it costs me my life!"
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Then she went into her most secret room, no one else was allowed inside, and she made a poisoned, poisoned apple. From the outside it was beautiful, white with red cheeks, and anyone who saw it would want it. But anyone who might eat a little piece of it would died. Then, coloring her face, she disguised herself as a peasant woman, and thus went across the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs. She knocked on the door.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Snow White stuck her head out the window and said, "I am not allowed to let anyone in. The dwarfs have forbidden me to do so."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"That is all right with me," answered the peasant woman. "I'll easily get rid of my apples. Here, I'll give you one of them."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"No," said Snow White, "I cannot accept anything."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							"Are you afraid of poison?" asked the old woman. "Look, I'll cut the apple in two. You eat the red half, and I shall eat the white half."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Now the apple had been so artfully made that only the red half was poisoned. Snow White longed for the beautiful apple, and when she saw that the peasant woman was eating part of it she could no longer resist, and she stuck her hand out and took the poisoned half. She barely had a bite in her mouth when she fell to the ground dead.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							The queen looked at her with a gruesome stare, laughed loudly, and said, "White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony wood! This time the dwarfs cannot awaken you."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Back at home she asked her mirror:
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who in this land is fairest of all? It finally answered:
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							You, my queen, are fairest of all. Then her envious heart was at rest, as well as an envious heart can be at rest.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							When the dwarfs came home that evening they found Snow White lying on the ground. She was not breathing at all. She was dead. They lifted her up and looked for something poisonous. They undid her laces. They combed her hair. They washed her with water and wine. But nothing helped. The dear child was dead, and she remained dead. They laid her on a bier, and all seven sat next to her and mourned for her and cried for three days. They were going to bury her, but she still looked as fresh as a living person, and still had her beautiful red cheeks.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							They said, "We cannot bury her in the black earth," and they had a transparent glass coffin made, so she could be seen from all sides. They laid her inside, and with golden letters wrote on it her name, and that she was a princess. Then they put the coffin outside on a mountain, and one of them always stayed with it and watched over her. The animals too came and mourned for Snow White, first an owl, then a raven, and finally a dove.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Snow White lay there in the coffin a long, long time, and she did not decay, but looked like she was asleep, for she was still as white as snow and as red as blood, and as black haired as ebony wood.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Now it came to pass that a prince entered these woods and happened onto the dwarfs' house, where he sought shelter for the night. He saw the coffin on the mountain with beautiful Snow White in it, and he read what was written on it with golden letters.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Then he said to the dwarfs, "Let me have the coffin. I will give you anything you want for it."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							But the dwarfs answered, "We will not sell it for all the gold in the world."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							Then he said, "Then give it to me, for I cannot live without being able to see Snow White. I will honor her and respect her as my most cherished one."
						</div>
					</p>
					<p> 
						<div class="snow_white_text">
							As he thus spoke, the good dwarfs felt pity for him and gave him the coffin. The prince had his servants carry it away on their shoulders. But then it happened that one of them stumbled on some brush, and this dislodged from Snow White's throat the piece of poisoned apple that she had bitten off. Not long afterward she opened her eyes, lifted the lid from her coffin, sat up, and was alive again.
						</div>
					</p>
					<p>
