		<h1>Reading Response 4
		</h1>

		<p> 
			I think something that this article really brings to light is the subjectivity of algorithms that try to find and report hate speech. For someone who does not really know the ins and outs of how algorithms like these are made and work, they hold so much power to me. I think a lot of times algorithms can be feel so concrete that we assume they are getting the job done. Before reading this article I thought, how is there room for reporting on social media be objective, the reports are based on algorithms, and numbers and logic are the least subjective things? However we don't realize, like this article points out, that there is a human that developed these algorithms and more importantly there is a human that needs to read these reports (a human that is usually from a different country from these reports and lacks context).
