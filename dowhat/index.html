    <h2> Do What?</h2>
    <p> 
        <ol>
        <li>
            Begin with a 4 in by 4 in piece of paper and a black ink pen.
        </li>
        <li> 
            With your dominant hand complete steps 3 through 8. If you are ambidextrous, begin with either hand.
        </li>
        <li>
           In the middle of the paper, draw a circle with an approximate 3 inch diameter. 
        </li>
         <li>
            From there, draw 4 more concentric circles inside of the first circle. Focus on keeping the spacing between the circles even. 
        </li>
         <li>
             At this point, your composition should look like a target made up of 5 ringed sections.
        </li>
        <li>
            Start with the outer ring. Completely fill in this ring by creating a radial pattern comprised of either circles, rectangles or triangles. Use only one of these three shapes to make your pattern around the ring. You may make these shapes as wide or as narrow as you would like, but be sure to keep the shapes and pattern that you create consistent and even.

        </li>
        <li>
            As you move inward, repeat this process of filling in the rings with one of the three shapes (circles, rectangles or triangles) in a radial pattern. Do not fill in the center. You may repeat the shapes you use as long as you continue to use one shape per ring and keep your shapes consistent.
        </li>
         <li>
            At this point, you're entire target should be filled in with a pattern in every ring except the center. In the center, cross hatch the circle. You can make the cross hatching as dark or as light as you would like.  
        </li>
         <li>
            On a second 4 inc by 4 inch piece of paper complete steps 3 through 8 with your non dominant hand. You may either replicate the same patterns you made before or make a different pattern, but be sure to follow the same steps.Â
