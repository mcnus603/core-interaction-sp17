		In Sina Bahramâ€™s talk, something that resonated with me is that accessible design should not be different from design for able people, it should be in additional. Instead of simply designing something separate for someone with a disability, you should figure out how to design something that people can interact with in a variety of different ways, so those with a disability can also interact with your original design instead of being excluded. A lot of the aspects of design that cause trouble for people are small nuances in the design. With interactive and multimedia work, Bahram talks about a lot of solutions possible for catering to all users. This made me think of a family friend of mine who has severe dyslexia and has trouble keeping his grades up in high school because of this. I know he sometimes uses a pen that records his lectures in classes where he has to take extensive notes. However, I wonder what other ways design could possibly aid him and help him lear better? With print and web, maybe there are typefaces that are easier to read for people who are dyslexic, maybe certain color combinations provide more contrast and clarity, or maybe there are certain type settings that differentiate the letters.
