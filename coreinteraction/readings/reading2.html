		<h1>Reading Response 2: Hugh Dubberly "What is interaction"
		</h1>

		<p> 
		
			In this article Dubberly, Pangro, and Haque point to defining interaction in a much more rigorous way. The article begins with a broad view of interaction from Meredith Davis, where interaction is “a way of framing the relationship between people and objects”. When presented to me, I liked this broad and all inclusive definition of interaction, but as the authors went in to what Haque points out as the difference between interaction which has a dynamic result and reaction which has a fixed result, I realized that it might be a more narrow definition instead of a broad one which would lead to greater design possibilities. Knowing the tedious different ways in which interaction works and looking at it from a more narrow view could be an easier way to see the greater possibilities for a more meaningful interaction.
